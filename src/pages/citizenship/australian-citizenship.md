Becoming an Australian citizen is the goal of many Australian immigrants and may be their last step of integration into the Australian community.

You may be eligible for Australian citizenship if you fall into one of the following categories:

You live in Australia and have an Australian permanent residency visa;
* You are an eligible New Zealand citizen living in Australia;
* You were born outside Australia to an Australian citizen parent;
* You have been adopted outside Australia by an Australian citizen;
* You are the child of a former Australian citizen who was an Australian citizen before you were born;
* You were born in Papua before 1975; or
* You have previously held Australian citizenship.

Becoming an Australian citizen usually involves lodging an application, being interviewed, sitting a test and then attending a citizenship ceremony where you will make the Australian Citizenship Pledge. The entire process usually takes several months from lodging your application to attending the ceremony.
