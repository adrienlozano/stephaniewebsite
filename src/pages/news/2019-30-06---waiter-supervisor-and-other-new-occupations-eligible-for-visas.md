Visa applicants have a new opportunity to obtain visas
including permanent residency through the Goldfields Designated Area Migration
Agreement (DAMA). This is a five year labour agreement between the Federal
Government, the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder and the Shires of Coolgardie,
Leonora and Menzies - a remote area in Western Australia most known for having
Australia’s second largest gold mine. The remoteness of the area means it has
had difficulty attracting Australian residents to provide much needed services which is why this DAMA was formed.

This new visa pathway utilises the labour agreement stream
of the Temporary Skill Shortage visa (subclass 482) and the Employer Nomination
Scheme (subclass 186) which means that visa applicants need to be sponsored by
an employer in the designated area in order to be eligible for a visa.

The DAMA includes [72 occupations](https://www.ckb.wa.gov.au/CKB/media/Documents/Economy%20and%20Growth/Documents/Table-of-Occupations-Included.pdf) including the following
which are not currently on any other visa occupation lists:

* Bar Attendant (Supervisor)
* Waiter (Supervisor)
* Driller
* Driller’s Assistant
* Earthmoving Plant Operator
* Loader Operator
* Mobile Plant Operators (not elsewhere classified)
* Truck Driver (General)

It also includes the occupation of Child Care Worker which
otherwise only appears on the list of eligible occupations for the Regional
Sponsored Migration Scheme visa (subclass 187).

If you have one of the above occupations and would like to
migrate to Australia this presents a rare opportunity to obtain a visa and even
permanent residency! The occupation of Driller’s Assistant, however, is the
only occupation that will not be eligible for permanent residency under the
arrangement.

Another advantage in obtaining a visa through this pathway
is that 28 of the occupations include an English language concession. This
means that applicants can score slightly lower than would normally be required in the individual speaking,
listening, reading or writing components of the English exam, however, must
still achieve the same minimum overall score. This helps those whose English is
slightly weaker in one of the four components still get over the line.

Only 500 nominations can be approved for visas under the
current DAMA and applications open on 1 July 2019 so if this sounds like an
opportunity for you, you had better get in quick! Remember the first step is to
find an employer to sponsor you in the designated area.
