From 1 July 2019, Work and Holiday Makers on their second
year visa will be able to work towards becoming eligible for a third year visa.
In order to meet the eligibility requirements, applicants must work in specified
areas of regional Australia for a period of 6 months.

Work and Holiday Makers already have to complete 3 months of
specified work in regional Australia in order to become eligible for their
second year visa. These work requirements are designed to address labour
shortages in regional Australia. 

Work and Holiday Makers are usually restricted to working
with the same employer for no more than 6 months, however, there are some exceptions
to this including where the work is in plant and animal cultivation anywhere in
Australia and work in certain industries in Northern Australia. 

The Work and Holiday Maker program includes the Subclass 417 (Working Holiday) visa and
the Subclass 462 (Work and Holiday) visa. Eligibility for the different visa
categories depends on the applicantâ€™s country of passport. Greece has just been
added to the list of countries that will be eligible for the Work and Holiday
visa program as of 1 July 2019.
