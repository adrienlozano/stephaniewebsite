A new Sponsored
Parent (Temporary) visa will soon be available that will allow parents of
Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents or eligible New Zealand
citizens to stay in Australia for up to 5 years at a time.

The new visa is
designed to reunite parents with their children in Australia and address long
wait times and limited places in other Parent category visas.

To be eligible for
this visa you must be either the biological, adoptive or step-parent of an
Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or eligible New Zealand
citizen who sponsors you for the visa. Sponsors must also have a minimum income
of $83,454.80, however, in some circumstances eligible family members can
contribute to meeting the income requirement.

Unlike other Parent
visas, the Balance of Family test will not apply to this new visa. This means
that you will only need one of your children in Australia who meets the sponsorship
requirements.

In order to apply
for this visa, first a sponsorship application must be approved. Applications
for sponsorship will open from 17 April 2019 and the associated visa
applications are planned to open from 1 July 2019. 

Parents can be
granted this visa twice in total, giving a total of 10 years stay in Australia.
However, in order to apply for the visa a second time, a parent must have been
outside Australia for at least 90 days, reflecting the fact the visa is
temporary in nature.

Visa holders will
not usually be able to work while on this visa and there is a cap of 15,000 visas
to be granted in each program year.

If you are
interested in coming to Australia to be close to your children, contact the
experienced staff at Moore Migration TODAY to discuss which Parent visa is the
best for you.
