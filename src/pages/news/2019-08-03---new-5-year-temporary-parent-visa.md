A new Sponsored Parent (Temporary) visa will be available
soon, allowing parents of Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents
or eligible New Zealand citizens to stay in Australia for up to 5 years at a
time. 

The new visa is designed to reunite parents with their children in
Australia and address long waiting times and limited places in other Parent
category visas. 

To be eligible for the visa you must be either the
biological, adoptive or step-parent of an Australian citizen, Australian permanent
resident or eligible New Zealand citizen who sponsors you for the visa. 

In order to apply for this visa, first a sponsorship
application must be approved. Applications for sponsorship will open from 17
April 2019 and the associated visa applications are planned to open from 1 July
2019\. 

Parents can be granted this visa twice in total, giving a
total of 10 years stay in Australia. However, in order to apply for the visa a
second time, a parent must have been outside Australia for at least 90 days,
reflecting the fact the visa is temporary in nature. 

Visa holders will not usually be able to work while on this
visa and there is a cap of 15,000 visas to be granted in each program year.

If you are interested in coming to Australia to be close to
your children, contact Moore Migration TODAY to discuss which Parent visa is
the best for you.
