In April this year the government surprised everyone by introducing caveats on certain occupations
for Subclass 457 visa applications. However, it has been suggested by prominent visa lawyers that
these caveats may be unlawful!

The caveats are essentially additional criteria that need to be satisfied by certain Subclass 457 visa
applicants in order for their visas to be granted. The caveats are occupation specific, and include
criteria such as:

* The sponsor’s annual business turnover must be more than $1 million;
* The minimum number of employees that must already be employed within the
sponsoring business;
* A minimum specified base salary (that is higher than normally required for a Subclass
457 visa); and
* A minimum amount of work experience required by the visa applicant.

The argument that these caveats are unlawful is based on a 2005 Federal Court case where it was
found that the Minister’s power includes specifying eligible skilled occupations, it does not go
further to specify sub-classifications within those occupations.

These caveats were introduced without any warning and are meant to apply to all future Subclass
457 visas. This means that some applicants who correctly lodged their Subclass 457 visa applications
before the introduction of the caveats and who were still waiting for a decision to be made when the
caveats were introduced, would no longer meet the criteria for their visa to be granted!

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is currently asking applicants who had
already lodged their Subclass 457 visa applications before the introduction of the caveats and do not
meet the criteria specified in the caveats to withdraw their applications for a refund. However, if
applicants are refused on the basis of the caveats, it is likely that appeals will follow.

Further changes to the visa occupation lists are due to come into effect on 1 July 2017.
