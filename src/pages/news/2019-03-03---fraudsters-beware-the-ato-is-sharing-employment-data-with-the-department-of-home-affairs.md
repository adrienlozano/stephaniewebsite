The ATO is sharing data with the Department of Home Affairs to
ensure that business sponsors are complying with their sponsorship obligations
and  visa holders are complying with their visa conditions. A finding of non-compliance could be used to cancel a
business’ sponsorship approval or a sponsored worker’s visa.

The data exchange is occurring in relation to people who
currently hold or have held a Temporary
Work (Skilled) (subclass 457) or Temporary Skills Shortage (subclass 482)
primary visa in the three most recently completed financial years and their
respective business sponsors.

The type of information the ATO is sharing with the Department of Home Affairs includes:

* How much a business is paying a sponsored visa holder;
* Whether a visa holder is only working for their approved employer; and
* Whether a visa holder is only working in their approved occupation.

you need advice or assistance with an employer sponsored visa, contact the experienced staff at Moore
Migration today.
