Becoming an Australian citizen is the goal of many migrants.
It gives you the right to live in Australia indefinitely, the right to vote, eligibility
for a range of government benefits such as Medicare and HECS and for many is
the final step to feeling completely integrated into the Australian community.
However, Australian citizenship is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain.  

On 20 April 2017 the Australian government announced that it
would be changing the requirements that need to be met in order to become an
Australian citizen. These changes will make it a lot more difficult for
migrants to obtain citizenship. Originally these changes were meant to come
into effect from 20 April 2017, however, amendments have meant that once the
Bill passes parliament, the changes will not come into effect until 1 July 2018.

The stricter requirements include the following:

* Applicants will have had to have lived in
  Australia as a permanent resident for 4 years immediately before applying
* Applicants will have to complete an English language test which will likely attract a significant additional fee
* Applicants will need to show how they have integrated into the Australian community
* The Australian values statement will be amended to include allegiance to Australia and an undertaking to integrate and
  contribute to the Australian community
* New questions will be added to the citizenship test relating to Australian values and the privileges and responsibilities of Australian
  citizenship
* The Australian Citizenship Pledge will be changed to refer to allegiance to Australia and requiring all applicants aged
  16 and over to make the pledge

The current citizenship requirements are much easier to meet
as you only have to have been a permanent resident for one year rather than
four, you do not have to complete an English language test (although you must
still pass the citizenship test which is in English) and there is no need to
demonstrate that you have integrated into the Australian community.

If you don’t want to have to meet the stricter citizenship
requirements, there is still time to apply as it’s the rules that are in force
on the date you apply that count.
