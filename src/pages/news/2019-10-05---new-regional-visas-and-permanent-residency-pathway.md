Two new skilled regional provisional visas will be
introduced in November 2019 and will provide a new pathway to permanent
residency.

The new visas will require visa holders to live and work in regional
Australia and will be granted for up to 5 years. The definition of ‘regional
Australia’ for skilled visas will be expanded in November 2019 to include all
of Australia except for the following metropolitan areas:

* Sydney
* Melbourne
* Brisbane
* Gold Coast
* Perth     
  

The two new provisional visas that will commence in November
2019 are as follows:

1\. Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional
\(Provisional) visa (Subclass 494) - This visa is for those who are
sponsored by an employer in regional Australia. This visa will have almost 700
eligible occupations.

2\.  Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) visa (Subclass 491) – This visa is for those who are either sponsored by an eligible
family member or nominated by a State or Territory government to live and work
in regional Australia. This is a points tested visa which will have almost 500
eligible occupations and will supersede the current Skilled Regional
\(Provisional) Visa (Subclass 489).

Holders of the above visas will be able to apply for
permanent residency after they have been living and working in a regional area
of Australia for at least three years. The new permanent visa is the Permanent
Residence (Skilled Regional) Visa (Subclass 191) and will be available from
November 2022.

The benefits of these new visas over current visas for
regional areas includes access to a wider range of occupations than
non-regional visas and priority processing for faster visa grants. This is
meant to make it more attractive for regional employers to sponsor skilled
workers which will assist in addressing skill shortages in regional areas.

Employer Sponsored visa, contact the experienced staff at Moore Migration today
