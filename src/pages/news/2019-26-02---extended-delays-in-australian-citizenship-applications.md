Are you still waiting for a decision on your Australian citizenship
by conferral application? If yes, you are not alone! 

Processing times have blown out since 2015 as the Department
of Home Affairs process less and less applications despite there being no
substantial changes in the application requirements and a decrease in the
number of complex cases being lodged. 

As of February 2019, it is taking 17 months for 75% of
Australian citizenship by conferral applications to be processed (form
lodgement to a decision being made to approve or refuse the application) and 21
months for 90% of applications to be processed. Applicants then need to attend
the citizenship ceremony before they officially become Australian citizens
which usually takes several more months. 

Previously, the Department had a target of 80 days in which to
make decisions on applications, however, this was removed as only 15% of
decisions were being made within the 80 days in 2017-2018. The Department
no-longer sets targets and instead publishes the current processing times taken
to acquire citizenship.

A report published by the Australian National Audit Office
on 11 February 2019 found that:

Australian citizenship by conferral applications
have NOT been processed in a time efficient manner

There have been long delays between the
lodgement of applications and decisions being made

Both complex and non-complex application have
been subject to significant periods of delay

The Australian Audit Office has made recommendations to
address the shortcomings it found, however, we will have to wait and see whether
these will have any effect on citizenship processing times.
