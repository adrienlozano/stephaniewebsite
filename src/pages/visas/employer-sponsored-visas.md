These visas are for those who have an occupation that is in demand in Australia, meet the skills requirements and have an employer who is willing to sponsor them in that occupation.
There are three types of employer sponsored visas:

1.	Temporary Work Visa (this is a temporary visa)
2.	Employer Nomination Scheme (this is a permanent visa)
3.	Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme (this is a permanent visa)

## Temporary Work Visa
In order to be eligible to apply for this visa you must have an eligible occupation. If your occupation is also on the Medium and Long-Term Strategic Skilled List then this visa may be granted for up to 4 years when the sponsor is an established business or up to 18 months when the sponsor is a start-up business or has traded in Australia for less than 12 months. Otherwise your visa may be granted for up to 2 years.
This visa is also a pathway to permanent residency as, once you have worked on this visa for 2 years with the same employer, you may be eligible to apply for the Employer Nomination Scheme or Regional Sponsored Nomination Scheme through the Temporary Residence Transition Scheme.
In order to be eligible to apply for this visa you must meet the skills requirements for your occupation which may include registration or licencing.  You will also have to meet English requirements unless an exemption applies and meet health and character requirements. Your employer will also have to meet certain requirements such as investing in training for their Australian citizen and permanent resident employees.

There are three stages in obtaining a Temporary Work Visa:

1.	The employer becomes an approved sponsor
2.	The employer nominates a prospective employee to fill a position in their business 
3.	The prospective employee then applies for a Temporary Work visa to fill this position
