These visas are for those who are in a relationship with an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or New Zealand citizen.

There are three types of visas for couples:

## Prospective Marriage Visa
This is a temporary visa for 9 months and is for couples who intend to marry within 9 months of the visa being granted. Visa applicants must be offshore when they lodge their application and offshore when a decision is made.

Couples must show evidence that they have met in person, are in a genuine relationship and that they are intending to marry within the required period. Applicants must meet medical requirements and applicants and sponsors must meet character requirements.

Once couples have married on this visa, they may then be eligible to apply for a Partner Visa which can lead to permanent residency in Australia.

Please note that if you are applying for this visa on the basis of your relationship with a New Zealand citizen, the New Zealand citizen must also meet certain eligibility criteria.

## Partner Visa

This visa is for those couples who are married or are in a de facto relationship. Same sex couples can apply for this visa on the basis of a de facto relationship. 

If you are applying on the basis of a de facto relationship, generally that relationship must have existed for at least 12 months before you apply for the visa, however, some exceptions apply. 

Please note that if you are applying for this visa on the basis of your relationship with a New Zealand citizen, the New Zealand citizen must also meet certain eligibility criteria.

Applicants for this visa must meet medical requirements and applicants and sponsors must meet character requirements.

This is a combined temporary and permanent visa application and it is processed in two stages; first the temporary visa is granted, then 2 years after the date the visa application was first made, the applicant becomes eligible to apply for the permanent visa.

Couples need to show evidence of the:

* Social aspects of their relationship
* Financial aspects of their relationship
* Nature of their household
* Nature of their commitment

### New Zealand Citizen Family Relationship Visa

If you are in relationship with a New Zealand citizen and are not eligible for one of the above visas, you may be able to apply for the New Zealand Citizen Family Relationship Visa. This is a temporary visa for 5 years, however, can be renewed multiple times and will allow you to work and study in Australia. 

You will need to show that you are married or in a de facto relationship with the New Zealand citizen who is in Australia on a Special Category visa. There are also health and character requirements.
