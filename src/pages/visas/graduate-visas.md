The Temporary Graduate visa allows those who have recently graduated from an Australian educational institution stay temporarily in Australia.
In order to be eligible for this visa you will need to be under 50 years of age, hold an eligible visa, meet the Australian study requirement, English requirements and have recently graduated.
This visa has two streams:

#### Graduate Work Stream
Visas under this stream are granted for 18 months to those students who graduate with an eligible occupation.

#### Post-Study Work Steam
Visas under this stream can be granted up to 4 years to those students who graduate with a degree and were granted their first student visa on or after 5 November 2011. The length of the visa will depend on the type of degree obtained.
