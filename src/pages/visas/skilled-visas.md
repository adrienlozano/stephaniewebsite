These visas are for skilled workers who are under 50 years of age, are able to obtain a positive Skills Assessment and have enough points on the points test to apply. Applicants will also need to meet health and character requirements.
In order to obtain a Skilled Visa you must:

* Obtain a positive skills assessment;
* Lodge an Expression of Interest for the visa you wish to apply for;
* If applicable, apply for and receive a nomination;
* Wait for an invitation to apply for your visa; and
* Apply for your visa.

There are three main types of Skilled Visas:

#### Skilled Independent Visa

This is a permanent residency visa that allows independent migration to Australia free from a sponsor. In order to apply for this visa, your occupation must appear on the Medium and Long-Term Strategic Skills List.

#### Skilled Nominated Visa

This is a permanent residency visa that allows migration for those whose occupations appear on the Short-Term Skilled Occupation List and have been nominated by a state or territory government agency. The eligibility criteria to receive nomination vary depending on the state or territory offering sponsorship.

#### Skilled Regional Visa

There are both temporary and permanent Skilled Regional visas. The temporary visa is a pathway to obtaining the permanent residency visa. The temporary visa is for those whose occupation appear on the relevant occupation list and who have been sponsored by a state or territory government agency to live, work and study in an area that is classified as a regional and low population growth metropolitan area or an eligible relative living in a designated area of Australia. 

Once you have a Skilled Regional (Provisional) visa, have lived in a specified regional area of Australia for at least two years and have worked full-time in a specified regional area for at least one year you may be eligible for the Skilled Regional (Residence) visa.
