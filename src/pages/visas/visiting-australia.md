Everyone who visits Australia needs a visa, even if you are just intending a short trip. There are several different types of visas to visit Australia and your eligibility for each depends on factors such as your country of passport and any criminal history you may have. These visas can allow you to visit Australia for up to 3, 6 or 12 months and may allow multiple entries during that period.

There are also two different types of working holiday visas that allow you to visit Australia and work for up to 6 months with any one employer within a 12-month period. Your eligibility for these visas will also depend on your country of passport.

Even though you are just intending a short visit, you will still need to meet health and character requirements and may need to show that you are a genuine temporary entrant.
