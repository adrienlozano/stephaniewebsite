These are temporary and permanent category visas that allow Australian citizens, permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens to bring their parents to Australia.

The main criteria for all Parent visas are as follows:

1.	You have a child who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident, or an eligible New Zealand citizen;
2.	At least half of your children live permanently in Australia, or more of your children live permanently in Australia than in any other country;
3.	One of your children has been living in Australia lawfully for at least 2 years before you lodge your visa application and is willing to sponsor you; and
4.	You meet health and character requirements.

Parent visas attract high application fees payable to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection or long processing times (approximately 30 years after your application has been queued). 

Contact our experienced staff at More Migration TODAY to ensure that you apply for the Parent visa that best suits your needs.
