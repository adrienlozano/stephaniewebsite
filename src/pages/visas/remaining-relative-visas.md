These are permanent residency visas for applicants whose only near relatives (including step-relatives) live in Australia. Your near relatives include your and your partnerâ€™s parents, siblings and children who are not dependent on you or your partner. To be eligible you must also be sponsored by an eligible relative, have someone provide an assurance of support (a commitment to provide financial support) and meet health and character requirements.

There are two subclasses of the Remaining Relative visa, one which can be applied for if you are in Australia, the other if you are outside Australia. They are both subject to capping and queuing arrangements which mean that only a small number of applications are being granted each year. As a result, applications are currently taking over 50 years to be released for final processing. This makes it particularly important to know whether you are eligible to apply for a Remaining Relative visa in Australia or not. If you are eligible to apply while in Australia you could be granted a bridging visa which will allow you to live in Australia during the processing time. If you apply while outside Australia you will not have the same right to stay in Australia while the visa is processing.
