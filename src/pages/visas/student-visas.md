Student visas are for those who wish to study in Australia. 

In order to apply you will first need a Confirmation of Enrolment from your chosen Australian educational institution. You may also have to meet English and financial capacity requirements as well as meeting health and character requirements and holding health insurance. 

The biggest hurdle in obtaining a Student visa for many applicants is demonstrating the requirement of being a ‘genuine temporary entrant’. To determine whether you meet this criteria, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection will make an assessment as to whether you are using the Student visa program for reasons other than to obtain a quality education. If you are assessed as not meeting this criteria, your application will likely be refused.

Contact our experienced staff at More Migration TODAY to discuss the genuine temporary entrant criteria and to secure your Student visa to Australia.
