Visa and Citizenship requirements are becoming increasing complex and are frequently changing. Just because you or someone you know made a similar visa application last year, last month or even yesterday does not mean that it will be possible to make that same application again today or tomorrow.

It is important to get your visa application right the first time otherwise you could waste time and money on appeals and multiple application fees. Even if you have researched your visa application yourself, nothing beats the experience of a registered migration agent who knows what the Department of Immigration and Border Protection is looking for and any hidden traps or loopholes that may exist to get your application over the line.
The first step for any visa application should be a consultation with a registered migration agent who can ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria for the visa you wish to apply for. 

At Moore Migration, you will receive expert advice from a registered migration agent who is also a qualified lawyer. This will ensure that you are getting the highest quality advice that only a thorough understanding of the law can deliver. 
Eligibility assessments can be conducted face-to-face, over the phone or by email.

Contact us at Moore Migration TODAY for a 10-minute FREE chat or for your comprehensive visa or citizenship eligibility assessment.
