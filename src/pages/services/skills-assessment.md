If you are applying for a Skilled visa or certain employer sponsored or Temporary Graduate visas, you will need a Skills Assessment. A Skills Assessments is when your qualifications and work experience are assessed by the relevant authority as suitable for your nominated occupation.

Obtaining a positive Skills Assessment is often one of the first steps to applying for a visa and needs to be done correctly the first time. Some assessing authorities have long processing times and if your current visa is expiring you may not have the time to apply for a Skills Assessment a second time if it was not prepared correctly the first time.
