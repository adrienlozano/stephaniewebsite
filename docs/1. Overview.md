This website is what is known as a [JAM stack](https://jamstack.org/) and comes with all of the associated benefits and tradeoffs.
We host via Netlify and don't make use of any server side rendering and leverage associated API's where it makes sense to do so.

Although there are a ton of benefits there are also a few things which become a bit harder for instance:

* Authoring and Access to user content
* Pagination for content
* Data Access
* Indexing and full text search

The above however is alleviated by frameworks and tools such as [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) 
in conjunction with hosting services provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). In addition to this, a number of services can be chosen for 
data access such as [graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/) or [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/). You can even solve the indexnig
and full text search limitations by leveraging a service such as [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

It should also be noted that all associated benefits of hosting with Netlify is also inherited i.e:

* Scaling via CDN
* Automated Deployments
* Domain Management
* Automatic SSL
* Form Submissions
* Authentication Providers
