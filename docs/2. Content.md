At the time of writing netlify CMS has not been added to the project however this article will cover updating content. In the mean time it is
expected that you can update content by using the following tools:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or similar editor
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Content for this site can be found in the following locations:

**Settings**
Name                               | Description 
---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
Global Site Settings               | src/app/settings.json
Global Theme Settings              | src/app/theme.js

**User Content**
Name                               | Description 
---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------
Services                           | src/pages/services/*.md
Visas                              | src/pages/visas/*.md
News                               | src/pages/news/*.md
Images                             | static/images
Internal Images                    | src/resources/images/*

All user generated images are to be either included as part of the site and located in static/images or via an absolute URL to a service such as
[cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). These images are included as a URL defined in frontmatter for associated user content. 
```yaml
    ---
    title: Australian Citizenship
    caption: Employer Sponsored Visas
    image: /images/citizenship/australian-citizenship.jpg
    thumb: /images/citizenship/australian-citizenship.thumb.jpg
    icon: certificate
    extract: Lorem ipsum some textum gosem herith. Thenith itith isith displayeth henceforeth
    order: 10
    ---
```

The title, caption, image, thumb, extract and order fields are shared across all user generated content. This is the same for services, visas and 
news articles.

News articles on the other hand have the following frontmatter
```yaml
    ---
    title: My news title
    date: "01-06-2017"
    caption: My Caption
    category: Visas
    tags: 
    - Unicorns
    - Animals
    - Ponies
    image: /images/services/appealing-visa-refusal.jpg
    ---
```
In addition to the above, the name of the folder where the new article is located is important. The current implementation uses a `---my-slug` suffix which indicates the long term slug name for the article for SEO purposes so using the frontmatter defined above along with a folder called `01-05-2017---my-slug` will result in the following:

* A url such as news/my-slug as defined by the `---my-slug` prefix which should remain for the lifetime of the article
* A date of 01-06-2017 used for ordering of news articles
* A top level category of "Visas"
* An article with the following tags: "Unicorns", "Animals", "Ponies" which can be used for filtering functionality
* A relative or abslute image URL which is used when highlighting an article on detail pages

**Please note** that is recommended to use absolute URL's to a service such as [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to avoid having to perform too
many manual image manipulations. This would also prevent the site from becomming too large and bogged down with too many images which will inevitably
become a problem i.e. slower builds, storage space, slow git clones etc. 

## Writing Content
All user content is written in a format called Markdown of which there is a an abundance of documentation and tools which can help the learning 
process. [This Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is just one such example along with tools such as [this live editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/)

The basics are:
```markdown
    # This is a heading
    ## This is a second level heading

    * This is a bullet point
    * This is another bullet point

    [this is a link](http://www.google.com)
    ![this is an image](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Tooltip text)
```

It's that simple, but before you go off writing any content let's first talk a bit about workflow.

## Basic Content Editing Workflow
As mentioned earlier in this document, we don't quite have the CMS in place yet which means there are some manual steps to deal with the versioning of 
content. This gives us tracability of individual changes and also ensures that written content doesn't blow up on the production site. We manage this
through a development tool called [git](https://git-scm.com/) of which we specifically use a third party service [github](https://github.com/) to 
provide us hosting to such repositories and is also the reason we require the git command line tools to be installed currently.

When wanting to create a new article you can follow the following steps:

```shell
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git checkout -b "article/visa"
    git push origin -u article/visa:article/visa
```

The above commands perform the following in order:
1. Swap to the master branch if you have no changes outstanding in your current branch
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote branch i.e. github
3. Create a new branch from the current master called "article/visa" and change to it
4. Create the local branch "article/visa" on github and name it "article/visa"

At this point in time you can create a new folder under `src/pages/news`. Let's choose something like
`01-05-2017---super-long-living-tag` and now we will create our base article under this folder called
`index.md`. Go ahead and add the associated frontmatter and content as per the above instructions.

Once you are happy with your changes we need to do the following:

```shell
    git add src/pages/news/01-05-2017---super-long-living-tag/index.md
    git commit -am "New article about visas"
    git push origin
```

This does the following:
1. Tells git to track the file `index.md` located at `src/pages/news/01-05-2017---super-long-living-tag` as it is new
2. We commit the current tracked files to our local repository with the message "New article about visas"
3. We push the content to our remote branch on github

At this point in time you can log into github and navigate to the repository and issue a pull request. Conflicts can then
be dealt with at this point by a developer.

**Please note** there are a number of tools that can be used instead of the git command line tools which could make the above a lot
easier, however the intention is to provide the netlify CMS to deal with this for you cutting out any specific knowledge required about
git and the associated workflows.
